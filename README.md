Jupyter Notebooks and datasets for AI educational purposes

This repository contains AI material used for the books and courses I author and co-author.

Everything is opensource to be shared and used by all.

Google Colaboratory Jupyter Notebooks are self-contained.

You access Google Colaboratory by clicking on one of the Jupyter Notebooks in any of the repositories in my environment on GitHub. Then click the Colab button at the top of the Notebook.

You can also download the Jupyter Notebook and open it from Colaboratory:
[Link to Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Once the Notebook has been opened, you can view the code as well as the last results calculated.
You can also run itself. 
To do so, for applications that require external data, in most cases, you will have to download the data in this repository contained in the directory named "datasets".
